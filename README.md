📊 RLC Circuit Analyser using Python

This project analyzes RLC circuits by plotting Bode plots and calculating stability parameters.

Features:
- Automatic identification of RC, RL, LC and RLC circuits
- Resonant frequency calculation
- Bode plot (Magnitude & Phase) generation
- Gain margin and Phase margin calculation
- Stability analysis

Files Included:
- RLC.py → Main Python code
